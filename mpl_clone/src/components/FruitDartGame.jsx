					Fruit Dart is a fun online dart game available on the MPL app. The
					objective of the game is to throw knives and slice the fruits popping
					up on the screen. The player has to touch anywhere on the screen to
					release the darts. With every fruit sliced, the player scores points,
					and the score is updated instantly. If the player hits two or more
					fruits with the same knife, the player is rewarded with extra points.
